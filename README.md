# TeamYellow
This is the repository for Team Yellow's project during COLLABOTHON2023.

## Breazy
Our project named Breazy is made with one main goal in mind, and that is to provide a solution to the at times problematic german bureaucracy.


We aim to provide users with a smooth experience where all the necessary processes involving completing transactions, uploading documents, receiving your desired documents and such are all united in one place.

_In essence, it's **B**u**r**eaucracy made **Easy**._


## Running the code
In order to properly run the code you'll need the following:
* Some of the necessary packages are npm, http-server (Both for JavaScript), and virtual env (for Python).
* An active virtual environment in python. This can be done by navigating to the backend directory and running **venv\Scripts\activate.bat**.
* From there, running **python app.py** should get the backend up and running.
* Next, you'll need to move to the frontend directory and run **http-server**.
* Finally, navigating to the given address, opening the Login page will start the entire user experience.
